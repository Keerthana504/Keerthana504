            F.R.I.E.N.D.S is an American Sitcom that was aired in early 1990’s
            and was a successful running show for a decade and remains popular
            in this generation also.

            Friends revolves around 6 group of 6 pals, that are neighbours in an
            apartment at NYC. They all gossip, chat and have coffees at a
            special place called <strong>Central Perk </strong>and this place is
            still known for the show.

            "Friends" is known for its humor, sarcasm, catchphrases,
            relationships and adventures of the characters. It has has a
            dedicated fan base even after 2 decades of its last episode, making
            it one of the most iconic and beloved sitcoms in the television

            In a personal note, I binge-watched Friends during the pandemic due
            to its innocence, unique concept, and extremely relatable journey to
            the present times of my life. I've seen the show several times over
            and yet never get tired of it.  I also bought a miniature of FRIENDS
            to cherish their memories at home.

            Friends will never feel the same now that Mathew Perry has passed
            away suddenly. Everybody feels an irreplaceable gap in their hearts.
            It is similar to losing a family member or close friend.
