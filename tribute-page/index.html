              The character that Mathew played was Chandler Bing, an IT
              professional and investor. Chandler is by nature a gentleman,
              witty, and sarcastic. Chandler passes comments and pulls his
              buddies' legs in awkward moments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chandler's character undergoes significant growth over the course
              of the series. He starts as the most commitment-phobic member of
              the group but gradually matures and becomes more responsible,
              especially after his relationship with Monica.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chandler is known for his distinctive use of the phrase "Could I
              BE any more...?" as a way to emphasize his sarcasm.

              On a personal note, I binge-watched Friends during the pandemic
              due to its innocence, unique concept, and extremely relatable
              journey to the present times of my life. I've seen the show
              several times over and yet never get tired of it.  I also bought a
              miniature of FRIENDS to cherish their memories at home.

              Friends will never feel the same now that Mathew Perry has passed
              away suddenly. Everybody feels an irreplaceable gap in their
              hearts. It is similar to losing a family member or close friend.
