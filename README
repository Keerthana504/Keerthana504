## Project Showcase

### Project 1: Beyond Eats 

- Description: Beyond Eats is a food delivery website built using the SWIGGY API (Real-time API) that SWIGGY Food Gaint (India) uses for its website.
I have created a clone of the SWIGGY website by developing the components from scratch. The website works dynamically by displaying the lip-smacking signature delicacies of restaurants. 
I maintained the same look and feel and also added my designs, functionalities, and features for uniqueness.
