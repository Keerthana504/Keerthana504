        <article>
          <p>
            Firstly, I began my career as an Analyst at Deloitte Consulting in
            India, where I initially worked on the Application Management for an
            insurance project that helped me gain knowledge on how a software
            company functions and its work culture. After working there for one
            and half years, I’ve got a good understanding of the software
            development life cycle and I developed an interest in frontend
            technologies and started taking on tasks such as debugging, solving
            website-related issues, and bug fixing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on various websites that use different tech stacks for the
            frontend. I’m thankful for this project because I have had
            opportunities to collaborate with different team leads and
            accomplish the tasks by utilizing my skills which helped in the
            significant growth of the team’s performance. I gained a lot of
            knowledge from my teammates and learned many new things about
            front-end development. I was a senior developer in the team, I was
            mentoring and onboarding the new teammates, I also provided KT on
            technologies and languages that aligned them with the team’s pace
            within a few weeks. I helped my juniors by providing them with right
            assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have received several awards and client appreciations. I was
            promoted twice in 6 years and was a consistent performer throughout
            my career at Deloitte by receiving Above and Exceptional performance
            reviews for most of the years.

                You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect
